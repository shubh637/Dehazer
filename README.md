# Smart Vehicles Surveillance in Foggy Conditions using Enhanced Deep Learning Algorithms

Foggy conditions pose significant challenges for vehicles due to reduced visibility, making it difficult for drivers 
to see other vehicles, pedestrians, and road signs, which increases the risk of accidents. Fog also distorts depth 
perception, complicating the ability to accurately judge distances and speeds of other vehicles, leading to 
potential collision.for this we use deep learning methods , While deep convolutional neural networks excel at 
eliminating fog, they also need to be able to handle photos taken in actual meteorological situations with 
patches of cloud cover or fog. Blur is harder to categorize in the actual world, and decreasing map or picture 
quality will result in output results with inconsistent colors or less content. Additionally, the model's 
complexity will rise with additional convolutional block stacking. Deep learning methods for fog image 
processing can be plagued by overfitting in addition to the challenge of gathering enough training data. This can 
restrict the capabilities of the model and make it difficult to use it practically in real-world situations.

This proposed an combined method for removing fog from surveillance images using WaveletFormerNet, a 
Transformer-based wavelet network designed for real-world non-homogeneous dense fog scenarios,this 
transformer method use the wavelet transform method.It also uses Multi-Object Detection with Enhanced 
YOLOv2 and LuNet Algorithms to detect objects. When these methods are combined, they can better handle the 
intricacies of hazy surroundings, improving both visibility and object detection precision. The effectiveness of 
the proposed technique is proven through rigorous testing, highlighting its potential to enhance the operation 
of monitoring systems in difficult weather situations
